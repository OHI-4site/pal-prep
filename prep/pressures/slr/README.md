## Palmyra Ocean Health Index: Sea Level Rise

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the sea level rise pressure layer. 


The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following files and sub-folders:     

- `slr_pressure_layer.Rmd` script to generate the pressure score for sea level rise     
- `slr_annual_rescaled.gif` animated gif showing change in sea level over time   
- `figs` folder with figures generated in the script   
- `output` folder with the layers generated in the script that are required for running the score calculation
