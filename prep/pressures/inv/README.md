## Palmyra Ocean Health Index: Invasive Species

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the invasive species pressure layer. 


The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following files and sub-folders:     

- `inv_spp_pressure.Rmd` script to generate the pressure score for invasive species     
- `output` folder with the layers generated in the script that are required for running the score calculation       
- `raw`  folder containing raw data on invasive species presence
