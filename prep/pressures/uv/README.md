## Palmyra Ocean Health Index: Ultraviolet Radiation

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the ultraviolet (uv) radiation pressure layer. 


The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following files and sub-folders:     

- `uv_pressure_layer.Rmd` script to generate the pressure score for sea surface temperature       
- `uv_annual_anoms.gif` animated gif showing the number of annual uv anomloies over time   
- `uv_rescale.gif` animated gif showing number of uv radiation anomolies after rescaling to the global reference point   
- `output` folder with the layers generated in the script that are required for running the score calculation
