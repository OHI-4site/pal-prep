## Palmyra Ocean Health Index: Sea Surface Temperature

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the sea surface temperature pressure layer. 


The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following files and sub-folders:     

- `sst_pressure_layer.Rmd` script to generate the pressure score for sea surface temperature       
- `sst_annual_anoms.gif` animated gif showing the number of annual sea surface temperature anomloies over time   
- `sst_rescale.gif` animated gif showing number of sea surface temperature anomolies after rescaling to the global reference point   
- `int` folder with all intermediate data generated in the script    
- `output` folder with the layers generated in the script that are required for running the score calculation
