## Palmyra Ocean Health Index: Tourism and Recreation 

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the data layers for the Tourism and Recreation goal. 


The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessment year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following files and sub-folders:  

- `tr-data_prep.rmd` script to generate the status score for tourism and recreation   
- `output`           folder containing layers generated in the script that are necessary to calculate the goal score
