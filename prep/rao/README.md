## Palmyra Ocean Health Index: Resource Access Opportunity 

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the data layers for the Resource Access Opportunity goal. 


The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following files and sub-folders:  

- `rao_data_prep.rmd` script to generate the status score for resource access opportunities   
- `output`            folder containing layers generated in the script that are necessary to calculate the goal score
