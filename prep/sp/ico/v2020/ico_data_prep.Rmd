# Summary:  Iconic Species Subgoal (Sense of Place)

This script prepares scores (status and trend) for Iconic Species in Palmyra.  For each iconic marine species, extinction risk category is pulled based on current and past assessments; by tracking the assessed extinction risk over time, we can understand the trends of extinction risk for iconic species directly rather than using the "population trend" method from prior OHI assessments.

The Iconic Species sub-goal model calculates status based upon an unweighted average of species health for all 'iconic' species found within the reporting region.

From Halpern et al (2012):

> Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a speciesâ€™ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual). ...
> Ultimately, almost any species can be iconic to someone, and so the intent with this goal was to focus on those species widely seen as iconic within a country, and iconic from a cultural or existence value (rather than for a livelihoods or extractive reason). ...
> The reference point is to have the risk status of all assessed species as Least Concern (i.e., a goal score = 1.0)
The Status of this sub-goal (X~ICO~) is then the % of iconic species in each threat category (as defined by the IUCN Red List), such that:

$$X_{ICO} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{category}S_{cat}*w_{cat}}{\displaystyle\sum_{category}S_{cat}}$$
where for each IUCN threat category:
* *S~cat~* is the number of assessed species in the category
* *w~cat~* is the status weight assigned for that category (note, these are the inverse of the risk value used in the SPP calculations):
    * 'LC' = 1.0, 'NT' = 0.8, 'VU' = 0.6, 'EN' = 0.4, 'CR' = 0.2, 'EX' = 0.0

ICO trend is calculated in a similar manner, but weightings are assigned according to IUCN population trend: 'Decreasing' = -0.5, 'Stable' = 0.0, 'Increasing' = +0.5.

# Methods

## Setup 

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(rredlist)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(raster)
library(here)

# Set filepaths and source functions
source(here('src/R/common.R'))

goal       <- 'globalprep/ico'
scenario   <- 'v2020'
dir_server <- file.path(dir_M, 'git-annex', goal)
dir_github <- '~/github/pal-prep/prep/sp/ico/v2020'

source(file.path(dir_github, 'ico_fxn.R'))

# Set api for access to IUCN:
api_file <- file.path(dir_M, 'git-annex/globalprep/spp', 'api_key_gc.csv')
api_key <- scan(api_file, what = 'character')
```

## Download Species List from IUCN 

Using the IUCN API, we accessed the full IUCN species list for the US Minor Outlying Islands at <http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/country/getspecies/id/%s?token=%s>. With some minor formatting, this list contains the following variables:

iucn_sid | scientific_name | subspecies | rank | subpopulation | category | country_code

```{r get-spp-iucn, eval=F}

## get a dataframe of all iucn redlist species
out <- rl_sp(all = TRUE, key = api_key)
all_df <- do.call(rbind, lapply(out, "[[", "result"))
all_df_comp <- all_df %>%
  dplyr::select(-infra_rank, -infra_name) %>%
    dplyr::rename(iucn_sid = taxonid, sciname = scientific_name) %>%
    setNames(names(.) %>%
               stringr::str_replace('_name', ''))


spp_country_url <- 'http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/country/getspecies/id/%s?token=%s'

countries <- rl_countries(key = api_key)

#UM is United States Minor Outlying Islands country code
# UM species risks (1532 species)
spp_um <- rl_sp_country('UM', key = api_key)$result %>%
  mutate(country_code = "UM") %>%
  rename("iucn_sid" = "taxonid")

# join with all_df_comp to get the kingdom,phylum,order, etc
spp_pal <- all_df_comp %>%
  inner_join(spp_um, by = c("iucn_sid", "category")) %>%
  dplyr::select(-scientific_name)

# Write UM species list as csv:
write_csv(spp_pal, file.path(dir_github, 'raw/spp_list_from_api.csv'))
```

## Get Iconic Species List

This initial list of iconic species is compiled based on USFWS birds, mammals, reptiles, and invertebrates list found [here](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Palmyra_Atoll/wildlife_and_habitat/index.html). 

Birds: brown booby (Sula leucogaster), masked booby (Sula dactylatra), red-footed booby (Sula sula), black noddy (Anous minutus),
brown noddy (Anous stolidus), great frigatebird (Fregata minor),sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscata),
bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis), pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), wandering tattler (Heteroscelus incanus),
ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres)   

Mammals: pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris),
melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra)   

Reptiles: green turtles (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata)    

Invertebrates: stony corals (many species), giant clams (Tridacna gigas), coconut crabs (Birgus latro)   

```{r usfws-ico-spp, eval=F}
# Create vector of iconic species scientific names from the USFWS webpage to cross reference (17 spp total)
# Note this list excludes specific coral and fish species that weren't listed on the USFWS webpage
sci_name <- c("Sula leucogaster", "Sula dactylatra", "Sula sula", "Anous minutus", "Anous stolidus",
          "Fregata minor", "Onychoprion fuscata", "Numenius tahitiensis", "Pluvialis fulva",
          "Heteroscelus incanus", "Arenaria interpres", "Tursiops aduncus", "Stenella longirostris",
          "Peponocephala electra", "Chelonia mydas", "Eretmochelys imbricata", "Tridacna gigas",
          "Birgus latro")
# Vector of common names (in same order as sci_name)
common_name <- c("Brown booby", "Masked booby", "Red-footed booby", "Black noddy", "Brown noddy", 
                 "Great frigatebird", "Sooty tern", "Bristle-thighed curlew", "Pacific golden plover",
                 "Wandering tattler", "Ruddy ternstone", "Pacific bottlenose dolphin", "Spinner dolphin",
                 "Melon-headed whales", "Green turtle", "Hawksbill turtle", "Giant clam", "Coconut crab")

# Create the USFWS ico species list, include same columns as global so they can be combined - comname, sciname, ico_gl, and ico_rgn_id
ico_list_usfws <- data.frame(comname = common_name, sciname = sci_name,
                             ico_gl = rep("FALSE", length(sci_name)), ico_rgn_id = rep(150, length(sci_name)))


# Write csv file
write_csv(ico_list_usfws, file.path(dir_github, 'raw/ico_list_usfws.csv'))
```

USFWS list is small, add the iconic species for US Minor Outlying Islands from the master iconic spp list used in the global assessment.  

The OHI global list of Iconic Species is based upon the original ICO list generated in 2011, using species identified as globally iconic (WWF Flagship species and Priority species) or regionally iconic (based upon WWF regional/local priority species and nation-specific lists).

```{r get-global-ico-spp, eval=F}
# ico master species list from Mazu: 'git-annex/globalprep/ico/ico/ico_global_list2016.csv'
# function called get_ico_list() defined in the ico_fxn.R file
ico_list_global <- get_ico_list(reload = TRUE) 

write_csv(ico_list_global, file.path(dir_github, 'raw/ico_list_global.csv'))
```

Filter the full global iconic species list for species that are globally iconic or species iconic to Palmyra Atoll (region id 150) and add the USFWS list to make a single iconic spp list  

```{r pal-ico-spp, eval=F}
ico_list_global <- read_csv(file.path(dir_github, "raw/ico_list_global.csv"))
ico_list_usfws  <- read_csv(file.path(dir_github, "raw/ico_list_usfws.csv"))

# Filter global species list for only those globally iconic or iconic to palmyra 
global_ico <- ico_list_raw %>% 
  filter(ico_gl == "TRUE" | ico_rgn_id == 150) # 39 total species from global list but none from rgn 150

# See if there is any overlap in the USFWS ico list and the global ico list
setdiff(ico_list_usfws$sciname, global_ico$sciname)

# Only two sea turtles are included in the global list - exclude these when combining the datasets 
ico_spp_pal <- ico_list_usfws %>% 
  filter(sciname != "Chelonia mydas" & sciname != "Eretmochelys imbricata") %>% 
  rbind(global_ico) # 55 species 

write_csv(ico_spp_pal, file.path(dir_github, 'raw/ico_list_pal.csv'))
```


## Identify extant ICO species populations

Filtering the complete IUCN species list for US Minor Outlying islands to include only the identified Iconic Species from either the USFWS website or the 2011 ico list.  

``` {r combine-iucn-spp-info-with-ico-list, eval= F}

spp_pal <- read_csv(file.path(dir_github, 'raw/spp_list_from_api.csv'))
ico_list_pal <- read_csv(file.path(dir_github, 'raw/ico_list_pal.csv')) 


# Get the status information for the 55 species 
ico_list <- ico_spp_pal %>%
  left_join(spp_pal %>% 
            dplyr::select(iucn_sid, sciname, category),
            by = 'sciname') %>% 
  mutate(all_na = ifelse(category == is.na(category) & iucn_sid == is.na(iucn_sid) & ico_rgn_id == is.na(ico_rgn_id), "yes", "no")) %>% 
  filter(all_na == "no") %>% # keep columns only for species found in palmyra 
  dplyr::select(-all_na)

## A few NAs from USFWS list:
# Figure out which ones didn't match
no_status <- ico_list %>% 
  filter(is.na(category) & ico_rgn_id == 150)

# Make vector of those that didn't match
ico_not_listed <- no_status$sciname

# Filter overall species list for those that didnt match
pal_ico_not_listed <- all_df_comp %>%
  filter(sciname %in% ico_not_listed) # found 4 of the 6 species

# Join this to the no status to fill in the missing data
no_status_fill <- no_status %>% 
  left_join(pal_ico_not_listed %>% 
              dplyr::select(iucn_sid, sciname, category),
            by = 'sciname') %>% # only two not matched 
  dplyr::select(-iucn_sid.x, -category.x) %>% 
  rename("iucn_sid" = "iucn_sid.y",
         "category" = "category.y")

# Still missing terns and tattlers but on IUCN webpage they both have a status of LC
no_status_fill$category[is.na(no_status_fill$category)] <- "LC"

# Join the filled in USFWS data back to the ico_list
ico_list_prepped <- ico_list %>% 
  rbind(no_status_fill) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(category))

write_csv(ico_list_prepped, file.path(dir_github, 'int/ico_list_prepped.csv')) #23 species in 2020
```
