## Palmyra Ocean Health Index: Habitat Resilience

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the habitat resilience layers. 


The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessment year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following files and sub-folders:     

- `hd_regulations.Rmd` script to generate the resilience score for rules and regulations against destructive activities in terrestrial and marine areas      
- `output` folder with the layers generated in the script that are required for running the score calculation       

To learn more about the ecological resilience layers, refer the project's [Supplemental Methods](https://ohi-4site.github.io/pal-scores/documents/methods-results/Supplement.html) document.
